# Federico Fuentes website

This is intended to be my personal webpage, especially as it relates to my academic work. 
You can expect to find links to my profile in the relevant academic databases (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, arXiv, ORCID, GitHub, Stackoverflow, etc.) as well as a brief overview of my research, teaching, and publication history. 
Please feel free to [browse the website](https://federicofuentes.github.io/)!
