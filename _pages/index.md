<p style="text-align: justify">
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at The Ohio State University.
</p>

<b> I am currently recruiting! </b>
Please take a look [here](/group/) if you are interested in working with me.


 <!-- Research Associate in the OPTIMUS Center of the Oden Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. -->
<p style="text-align: justify">
I work on numerical methods for the inference, prediction, and optimal design and control of complex physical systems. Of particular interest are systems mathematically modeled by parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs).
My work blends numerical analysis, machine learning, and mechanistic modeling to create state-of-the-art methods to support decision making regarding complex systems under high-dimensional uncertainty.

<b> Short Bio: </b> I completed my PhD in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/" style="color:black">Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~omar/" style="color:black">Omar Ghattas</a> and the co-supervision of <a href="https://heimbach.wordpress.com/" style="color:black">Patrick Heimbach</a>. 
Before that I completed degrees in Engineering Mechanics and Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.
