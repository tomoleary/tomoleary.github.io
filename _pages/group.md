If you are interested in joining my research group, please reach out via email with a short summary of your research interests and a CV. Please put "Prospective [insert position here]" in the subject line. 

My current research focuses on operator learning for parametric partial differential equations, simulation of complex physical systems and mathematical optimization. 

I am particularly interested in research projects related to inverse problems, data assimilation, PDE-constrained optimization, generic stochastic optimization and deep learning. I am open to advising on projects in general areas of computational mathematics that overlap with these topics. 

## Math PhD students at OSU

Current and prospective [math PhD](https://math.osu.edu/grad/future/phd) students at OSU are encouraged to reach out. 

## Undergraduates at OSU

If you are a motivated undergraduate student who has taken some courses in numerical analysis, computing, partial differential equations or machine learning and would like to do a directed reading or research project please reach out. 

## Postdocs

I am not currently hiring for postdoctoral positions, but hope to be soon. 

If you are a senior PhD student nearing graduation, or current postdoc who is interested in working with me please reach out.
